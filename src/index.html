        <p>
          <span>T</span>he sea is mighty, but a mightier sways
          <br>
          His restless billows. Thou, whose hands have scooped
          <br>
          His boundless gulfs and built his shore, thy breath
          <br>
          That moved in the beginning o'er his face,
          <br>
          Moves o'er it evermore. The obedient waves
          <br>
          To its strong motion roll, and rise and fall.
          <br>
          Still from that realm of rain thy cloud goes up,
          <br>
          As at the first, to water the great earth,
          <br>
          And keep her valleys green. A hundred realms
          <br>
          Watch its broad shadow warping on the wind,
          <br>
          And in the dropping shower, with gladness hear
          <br>
          Thy promise of the harvest. I look forth
          <br>
          Over the boundless blue, where joyously
          <br>
          The bright crests of innumerable waves
          <br>
          Glance to the sun at once, as when the hands
          <br>
          Of a great multitude are upward flung
          <br>
          In acclamation. I behold the ships
          <br>
          Gliding from cape to cape, from isle to isle,
          <br>
          Or stemming toward far lands, or hastening home
          <br>
          From the old world. It is thy friendly breeze
          <br>
          That bears them, with the riches of the land,
          <br>
          And treasure of dear lives, till, in the port,
          <br>
          The shouting seaman climbs and furls the sail.
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>But who shall bide thy tempest, who shall face
          <br>
          The blast that wakes the fury of the sea?
          <br>
          Oh God! thy justice makes the world turn pale,
          <br>
          When on the armed fleet, that royally
          <br>
          Bears down the surges, carrying war, to smite
          <br>
          Some city, or invade some thoughtless realm,
          <br>
          Descends the fierce tornado. The vast hulks
          <br>
          Are whirled like chaff upon the waves; the sails
          <br>
          Fly, rent like webs of gossamer; the masts
          <br>
          Are snapped asunder; downward from the decks,
          <br>
          Downward are slung, into the fathomless gulf,
          <br>
          Their cruel engines; and their hosts, arrayed
          <br>
          In trappings of the battle-field, are whelmed
          <br>
          By whirlpools, or dashed dead upon the rocks.
          <br>
          Then stand the nations still with awe, and pause,
          <br>
          A moment, from the bloody work of war.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>These restless surges eat away the shores
          <br>
          Of earth's old continents; the fertile plain
          <br>
          Welters in shallows, headlands crumble down,
          <br>
          And the tide drifts the sea-sand in the streets
          <br>
          Of the drowned city. Thou, meanwhile, afar
          <br>
          In the green chambers of the middle sea,
          <br>
          Where broadest spread the waters and the line
          <br>
          Sinks deepest, while no eye beholds thy work,
          <br>
          Creator! thou dost teach the coral worm
          <br>
          To lay his mighty reefs. From age to age,
          <br>
          He builds beneath the waters, till, at last,
          <br>
          His bulwarks overtop the brine, and check
          <br>
          The long wave rolling from the southern pole
          <br>
          To break upon Japan. Thou bid'st the fires,
          <br>
          That smoulder under ocean, heave on high
          <br>
          The new-made mountains, and uplift their peaks,
          <br>
          A place of refuge for the storm-driven bird.
          <br>
          The birds and wafting billows plant the rifts
          <br>
          With herb and tree; sweet fountains gush; sweet airs
          <br>
          Ripple the living lakes that, fringed with flowers,
          <br>
          Are gathered in the hollows. Thou dost look
          <br>
          On thy creation and pronounce it good.
          <br>
          Its valleys, glorious with their summer green,
          <br>
          Praise thee in silent beauty, and its woods,
          <br>
          Swept by the murmuring winds of ocean, join
          <br>
          The murmuring shores in a perpetual hymn.
